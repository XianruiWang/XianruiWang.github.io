I received the bachelor’s degree in control science and technology in 2019 from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an, China, where I am currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering with the [Center of Intelligent Acoustics and Immersive Communications](https://www.ciaic.org/). My advisors are Prof. [Jingdong Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hWAy1jcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), Prof. [Walter Kellermann](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HmreEZUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and Prof. [Shoji Makino](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pBQfV8QAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I also work closely with Prof. [Jacob Benesty](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8i3o6DUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), Prof. [Israel Cohen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZkQc3WMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), Prof. [Gongping Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a3x1k7kAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), Dr. [Andreas Brendel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LyzozeAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Yichen Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=880ogZcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I am currently a Visiting Research Fellow with Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan. My research interests include blind and semi-blind source separation and extraction, acoustic echo cancellation, speech dereverberation, and source localization. I am a reviewer of IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS, IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS, Sensors and Actuators A: Physical, and IEEE ICASSP
